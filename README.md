Moonshot Arena is a round based survival game. The goal is to survive as many waves of enemies as you can.
Game is made using WebGL2 and ammo physics.

## Building and running
The game does not need to be built, but requires a server
capable of serving static files (WebGL+CORS restrictions).

If python is installed, a decent enough server for this task is:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
