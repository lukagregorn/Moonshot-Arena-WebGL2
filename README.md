# Moonshot Arena
![alt text](./assets/ui/TitleText.png?raw=true)
University project made with WebGL2. Goal of the game is to survive as many rounds of enemies as you can.

## Building and running
The game does not need to be built, but requires a server
capable of serving static files (WebGL+CORS restrictions).

If python is installed, a decent enough server for this task is:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
